# Task_Manager

## Description
This project is a Task Manager App that allows the user to log into their existing account and then create and assign, edit or mark complete tasks. There is one 'super-user', admin, who is allowed to see certian reports in their main menu that is not visisble to any of the other users. This user is also the only one allowed to create a new user for the app.

This app saves and pulls the data from text files, which helps to not lose the data once the program is stopped.


## Installation
Simply run the project in your code editor, just make sure you have the nessecary things installed to run a Python program, since this is solely built on Python.


## Usage
The text files should be saved in the same directory as the main .py file.

The super user details are:
username = admin
password adm1n

Any other details regarding users details or task details can also be accessed via the textfiles themselves if you should want to corrolate any data or get other login data.
